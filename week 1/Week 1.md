# Week 1: Introduction to Prompt Engineering Internship

## Overview

Week 1 marked the beginning of our Prompt Engineering Virtual Internship with **Excelerate Learning**. The primary focus of this week was to build foundational knowledge about prompt engineering principles and familiarize ourselves with the AI tools we will be evaluating throughout the internship.

We conducted a comprehensive analysis of six leading AI tools—**OpenAI, Cohere, Claude (Anthropic), Microsoft Azure AI, Hugging Face, and Google Gemini**—to understand their features, strengths, limitations, and suitability for specific use cases in learning programs and enterprise environments. Additionally, we drafted a detailed research plan for the upcoming weeks, outlining objectives, focus areas, and methodologies.
